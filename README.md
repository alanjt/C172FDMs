# C172datcom
This is a simple model of the C172r, taken from Flightgear´s FGaddon SVN repository. It is deliberately a very basic aircraft, without glass cockpit, skis, bush wheels, floats etc. and has a very simple 3d model.
The purpose of the simple model is to explore FDM´s and to conduct flight tests.

The version in Flightgear´s FGdata GIT repository has a much more detailed 3D model as well as the glass cockpit and other add-ons listed above.
